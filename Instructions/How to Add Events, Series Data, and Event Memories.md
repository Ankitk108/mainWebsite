# How to Add Events, Series Data, and Event Memories

## Adding Upcoming Events

1. **Locate the Data File:**
   - Open the JavaScript file located at `data_lists/events_data.js`.

2. **Add the Upcoming Event Data:**
   - Use the following structure to add a new event to the `upcomingEventList` object. Replace the placeholders with the actual event details.

```javascript
upcomingEventList: [
    {
        eventName: /* 'EVENT NAME' */, // e.g., 'INST Lab Tour'
        eventDate: /* 'YYYY-MM-DD' */, // e.g., '2022-08-30'
        eventTime: /* 'HH:MM AM/PM' */, // e.g., '11:00 AM'
        eventVenue: /* 'EVENT VENUE' */, // e.g., 'INST'
        eventDescription: /* 'DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT' */, // Optional: Add a brief description
    },
    // Add more events here as needed
]
```

### Example of an Upcoming Event Entry

```javascript
upcomingEventList: [
    {
        eventName: "INST Lab Tour",
        eventDate: "2022-08-30",
        eventTime: "11:00 AM",
        eventVenue: "INST",
        eventDescription: "A guided tour of the INST laboratories where students will learn about cutting-edge research equipment.",
    }
]
```




## Adding Recent Events

1. **Locate the Data File:**
   - Open the JavaScript file located at `data_lists/events_data.js`.

2. **Add the Recent Event Data:**
   - Use the following structure to add a recent event to the `recentEventList` object. Replace the placeholders with the actual event details.

```javascript
recentEventList: [
    {
        type: /* 'EVENT TYPE' */, // e.g., 'Lab Tour'
        eventName: /* 'EVENT NAME' */, // e.g., 'INST Lab Tour'
        eventDescription: /* 'DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT' */ // Provide a brief description of what the event was about
    },
    // Add more recent events here as needed
]
```

### Example of a Recent Event Entry

```javascript
recentEventList: [
    {
        type: "Lab Tour",
        eventName: "INST Lab Tour",
        eventDescription: "A lab tour to INST, where students see and learn about various machines and equipment used for research works in INST Mohali."
    }
]
```




## Adding Ongoing Series

1. **Locate the Data File:**
   - Open the JavaScript file located at `data_lists/events_data.js`.

2. **Add the Ongoing Series Data:**
   - Use the following structure to add a series to the `onGoingSeriesList` object. Replace the placeholders with the actual series details.

```javascript
onGoingSeriesList: [
    {
        seriesName: /* 'SERIES NAME' */, // e.g., 'Molecule Of The Week'
        seriesDescription: /* 'DESCRIPTION OF THE SERIES' */, // Provide a brief description of the series
        link: /* 'LINK TO SERIES PAGE' */, // e.g., 'htmls/molecule-of-the-week.html'
        lineClamp: /* NUMBER OF LINES TO CLAMP THE DESCRIPTION */ // e.g., 3
    },
    // Add more series here as needed
]
```

### Example of an Ongoing Series Entry

```javascript
onGoingSeriesList: [
    {
        seriesName: "Molecule Of The Week",
        seriesDescription: "Join us every week as we explore a new molecule and its significance in chemistry. If you're interested in contributing and suggesting a molecule, get in touch!",
        link: "htmls/molecule-of-the-week.html",
        lineClamp: 3
    }
]
```




## Adding Recent Event Memories

### Uploading Images for Recent Event Memories

1. **Locate the Assets Folder:**
   - Navigate to the `assets/events_images/` directory.

2. **Upload the Image:**
   - Upload the image file related to the recent event. Ensure that the image is in `.webp` format to optimize loading times. You can use any online converter to change the image format to `.webp` if necessary.

3. **Naming the Image File:**
   - Name the image file appropriately, reflecting the event name or a brief description (e.g., `INST_lab_tour.webp`).

### Adding the Event Memory Image

1. **Locate the Data File:**
   - Open the JavaScript file located at `data_lists/recent_event_memories.js`.

2. **Add the Event Memory Image:**
   - Use the following structure to add a new image to the `images` object. Replace the placeholders with the actual image details.

```javascript
images: [
    {
        src: /* 'IMAGE SOURCE' */, // e.g., 'assets/events_images/INST_lab_tour.webp'
        alt: /* 'ALT TEXT' */ // e.g., 'INST Lab Tour'
    },
    // Add more images here as needed
]
```

### Example of a Recent Event Memory Entry

```javascript
images: [
    {
        src: "assets/events_images/INST_lab_tour.webp",
        alt: "INST Lab Tour"
    }
]
```
