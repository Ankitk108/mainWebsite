# How to Update Coordinators' Information

## Uploading Coordinator Images

1. **Prepare the Image:**
   - Ensure that the coordinator's image is in `.webp` format. If the image is not in `.webp`, use an online converter to convert it to this format.

2. **Locate the Image Directory:**
   - Navigate to the directory where coordinator images are stored: `assests/Coordinaters_images/`.

3. **Upload the Image:**
   - Place the `.webp` image file in the `assests/Coordinaters_images/` directory. Name the image file appropriately, following the format used for other images (e.g., `name_profile_pic.webp`).

4. **Check Image Path:**
   - Verify that the image is correctly placed in the directory and that the path follows the pattern `assests/Coordinaters_images/your_image_name.webp`.

## Updating Coordinator Details

1. **Locate the Data File:**
   - Open the JavaScript file located at `data_lists/coordinators_data.js`.

2. **Update Coordinator Names, Positions, and Image Paths:**
   - Modify the existing coordinator objects in the `coordinators` array. You can change the `name`, `position`, and `image` fields, but do not add or remove items from the array.

```javascript
export const coordinators = [
    {
        name: "New Name 1", // e.g., "Ankit"
        position: "Co-convener", // e.g., "Co-convener"
        image: "assests/Coordinaters_images/your_image_name1.webp" // e.g., "ankit_profile_pic.webp"
    },
    {
        name: "New Name 2", // e.g., "Prince Raj"
        position: "Convener", // e.g., "Convener"
        image: "assests/Coordinaters_images/your_image_name2.webp" // e.g., "prince_profile_pic.webp"
    },
    {
        name: "New Name 3", // e.g., "Manoj Soni"
        position: "Co-convener", // e.g., "Co-convener"
        image: "assests/Coordinaters_images/your_image_name3.webp" // e.g., "manoj_profile_pic.webp"
    }
];
```

### Example of Updated Coordinators Entry

```javascript
export const coordinators = [
    {
        name: "Ankit",
        position: "Co-convener",
        image: "assests/Coordinaters_images/ankit_profile_pic.webp"
    },
    {
        name: "Prince Raj",
        position: "Convener",
        image: "assests/Coordinaters_images/prince_profile_pic.webp"
    },
    {
        name: "Manoj Soni",
        position: "Co-convener",
        image: "assests/Coordinaters_images/manoj_profile_pic.webp"
    }
];
```

## Important Notes:
- Ensure that the image file names are descriptive and consistent with the naming convention used in the directory.
- Double-check the image paths in the `coordinators_data.js` file to avoid any broken links or missing images.
